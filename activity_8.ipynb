    "The files in the `data/enzyme` are from a study to measure an enzyme's activity. The assay takes advantage of a plate reader to monitor the absorbance of multiple reactions with different initial substrate concentrations over time. Plate readers are great because they allow for lots of data to be generated but it can be a challenge dealing with it all! Let's develop a Python workflow to handle this data. First, how can we deal with multiple files? The [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module of the standard library allows for easy iteration through a directory. The `.name` attribute of a path object contains the file name. Complete the following `for in` loop to print the name of each `.prx` file in the `data/enzyme` directory."

This is followed by the data (concentration of product) in concentration units (micromolar).
