Its output files have a `.prx` extension and these files contain notes fields with the total time the reaction has occurred (in seconds) and the initial concentration of substrate of the corresponding wells. This is followed by the data (concentration of product) in concentration units (micromolar). Note that the data field contains measurements for all 96 wells, some of which may not have anything in them (as described in the initial concentration field). \n",

    "The files in the `data/enzyme` directory are from a study to measure an enzyme's activity. The assay takes advantage of a plate reader to monitor the absorbance of multiple reactions with different initial substrate concentrations over time. Plate readers are great because they allow for lots of data to be collected but it can be a challenge dealing with it all! Let's develop a Python workflow to handle these data. First, how can we deal with multiple files? The [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module of the standard library allows for easy iteration through a directory. The `.name` attribute of a path object contains the file name. Complete the following `for in` loop to print the name of each `.prx` file in the `data/enzyme` directory."
